# DynamicWrapper
Think of it as ExpandoObject++

## Features
Provides access to a wrapped class' properties, methods, and indexers.

Allows you to add more properties and or methods to the wrapped instance.

The main feature of the DynamicWrapper is to provide a painless solution to the implementation of the INotifyPropertyChanged interface.

The DynamicWrapper.PropertyChanged event will be raised every time the properties of the wrapped object, or the dynamically added properties are changed.

More features will be added.
